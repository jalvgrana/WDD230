			<p>The largest caribbean island in Mexico, Cozumel, sits just on the eastern edge of the Yucatan Peninsula. Known for azure blue water, pristine coral reefs and gentle currents that sweep divers along, Cozumel is arguably one of the premier dive spots in the entire Caribbean. Settled by the Mayan originally, what once was a small fishing community has now become a mecca for watersports enthusiasts and triathletes worldwide.
				Cozumel measures 48 kilometers (30 miles) from north to south but only 16 kilometers (10 miles) from east to west. The island’s commercial and residential center, San Miguel, is located on the leeward, or eastern, side of the island, and flanked by both a north and south hotel zone. There is also another smaller town, Cedral, located toward the south. Generally speaking, most of the development occurs between these two areas, although there are a few establishments found on the western, or windward, side.
				Colloquially called the “wild side” the windward side of Cozumel is composed of natural, undeveloped beaches, crashing waves, and very strong currents. Where the ironshore rocks meet the ocean it’s not unusual to find natural geysers and Jacuzzis caused by wave action. </p>

			<p>Visitors will also find local beach clubs serving extremely fresh seafood and icy cold beer. This side of the island does not have electricity, so most of these locations close when the sun sets or the mosquitoes come out, whichever comes first. Recently renovated, Cozumel is home to a modern international airport, with free, easily accessible wi-fi access throughout the downtown shopping areas and all public parks. Several major grocery chains, including Commercial Mexicana, have locations on island, and carry a wide variety of national and international products, a in-store bakery and a liquor section. In spite of all the modern amenities Cozumel still retains the charm of its Mayan/Mexican roots. Cozumel is an extremely safe island, with a very low crime rate, as opposed to some other tourist destinations in Mexico or the Caribbean. Cozumel sits alongside the Mesoamerican Reef System, which is actually the second largest barrier reef system in the world. Strong currents are the norm, which create virtually effortless diving, as you drift along the reefs. Another benefit of the currents is outstanding visibility. It’s not uncommon to have 120ft/35m viz, with 80ft/25m being the norm.

			<p>If you’re looking to strike out on your own, there are a variety of vehicles available for rent, including, automobiles, electric cars, and even tuk –tuks, (small motorized carts).
				Downtown San Miguel has been conveniently laid out so it’s very easy to get around. The streets are laid out, grid-like, with the Avenidas running horizontal to the ocean, and the Calles perpendicular. Avenidas run in multiples of 5, while calles to the north of downtown are even numbered and calles on the southern side are odd numbered. Most directions are given with the cross street included for reference. Remember while driving Avenidas have the right of way, so while driving on a Calle you will generally need to stop at each intersection. Of course, exceptions to these generalizations abound. It is prohibited to park in areas with a red curb. Areas with a yellow curb may also have signage indicating regulations. Cozumel Police will generally take the license plate off of your car, rather than ticket, so it’s generally a wise idea to pay one of the many secure parking lots throughout downtown. There is one main road that transverses the island, in route to the windward side of the island.
