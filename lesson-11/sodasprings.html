			<h2 class="text-bulleye">Soda Springs Geyser</h2>
			<p class="text-bulleye">The city is named for the hundreds of natural springs of carbonated water that are located in and around the city. The springs were well known to Native Americans and were a famous landmark along the Oregon Trail in the middle 19th century. Today the city is also known as the location of the Soda Springs Geyser, which was unleashed in 1934 when "town fathers" were looking for hot water for a "hot pool" bathing attraction. Instead they drilled into a chamber of highly pressurized carbon dioxide gas and cold water and the geyser was released. After running for weeks, and flooding the downtown area, it was capped and manually released when requested as a tourist attraction. Now it is let loose every hour on the hour by a timed release valve. Its height and volume have not decreased after many years. There are viewing platforms at either end of the travertine mound where the geyser erupts. Interpretive signs are located on the platforms explaining this phenomenon. Soda Springs is also the location of one of the Ground Observer Corps sites. Soda Springs has the only captive geyser in the world. It was discovered in an attempt to find a hot water source for a swimming pool. On November 30, 1937, the drill went down 315 feet and unleashed the geyser. The extreme pressure is caused by carbon dioxide gas mixing with water in an underground chamber. It is now capped and controlled by a timer. It erupts every hour on the hour. The geyser reaches heights of 100 feet year round.There is a Visitor Center which features interpretive signs and restrooms in the park. There is a boardwalk around the geyser and grassy areas with picnic tables and benches to enjoy the day and view the geyser. The geyser is located behind the Enders Hotel located on 1st South and Main. Soda Springs boasts having the worldâ€™s only captive geyser. On November 30, 1937 in an attempt to find a hot water source for a local swimming pool, a well driller set free the natural geyser at a depth of 317 feet. It is located on Pyramid Spring, a travertine mound described by Fremont in his 1840s expeditions, along with other area springs. The history of Soda Springs and Caribou County is portrayed on picture boards in the Geyser Park Visitor Center. Historical artifacts and antiques are on display next door at the Enders Hotel Museum. Enter on Main Street & 1st Street South and drive 150 feet west to Geyser Park.</p>
