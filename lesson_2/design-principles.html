            <h3>Amazon</h3>
            <h4>PARC: Contrast</h4>
            <p>Contrast to be effective must be strong. Amazon alternates two primary colors (blue and white) for the
                entire website. Then blue uses different degrees of saturation, making it stronger in the primary
                part, the navigation-bar, and lighter in the secondary areas. When they want to call our attention to a
                key component (sign-up button) they use a very bright and warm color: orange. The contrast in the page
                makes clear they want two things from us: to search for something and to sign-up. And those are the two
                main features of the company: to look for products and to buy them by signing-up as a user.</p>

            <h3>Deseret Book</h3>
            <h4>PARC: Proximity</h4>
            <p>
                They group related items together by areas making clear the association between them. Proximity is not
                just closeness but intellectual connection of the items trying to organize information. They want to
                really emphasize that General Conference is coming in short time because the date clearly strikes out
                taking about 1/3 of the page. Then, second in importance, they want to inform us of their two most
                important features: an online reading service and their full-catalog. And lastly, third in importance,
                they want to present their gift-section with three different sections. Between the sections there is
                separation using margins on the section-blocks indicating what belongs to what.

            <h3>McDonald's</h3>
            <h4>McDonald’s: PARC Alignment</h4>
            <p>
                There’s a basic and strong left-side alignment. First are making an offer in bold and big-size font.
                They break the alignment with the photo of the hamburger on the right, but the rest of the layout is
                left-sided. The left-alignment creates empty space that is very gentle to the eye. It’s not a CostCo or
                Wallmart webpage where they need to make us aware of their many offers in as little time as possible.
                Here just one idea: there is a burger and a good offer. They convey more messages but the reader’s eye
                not fully interested won’t be disturbed until they call again our attention with the App-button.
