        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <h3>Two Personas:</h3>
        
        <h4>Julia</h4>
        <p>Julia is a native from Coruña (Spain). She is a mother of 5 and works from home as a computer designer. She has little time to do house’s chores and needs a reliable source to know if she has to hang or not her clothing to dry outside. Having a large family means having to use the washer-machine during the day and although she has a drier, she loves having clothes outside in her back-yard. But weather changes very much in Coruña and at home there is always much debate and different opinions on how the weather will be like in a few hours. She needs to use her time in an efficient manner and wants to plan things first thing in the morning.</p>

        <h4>Roberto</h4>
        <p>Roberto lives in Oviedo (Spain) is a company-seller and is visiting his clients all day long. That means having to spend pretty much all his working-day from one place to the other. When visiting clients in the down-town he cannot use his car an must walk to his appointments. Deciding whether to take his umbrella or not is a big deal: it is not the first time he believed the weather would be fine but started to rain heavily and arrived to the place totally soaked. Or believed that it was going to rain and arrived to the meeting  with an umbrella and clients started to make jokes about him to discover later on that because it was sunny he forgot his umbrella in the meeting room having to go back and lose time in between appointments. He would like to know exactly if he has to take or not his umbrella with him. </p>
